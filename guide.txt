My project is an algorithm for the operation of a standard smart barrier.
This code is a prototype and will be improved.
 
What do you need for the code to work?
1) Install pytesseract and specify the path to it.
3) Have an account on Twilio, enter data into variables.
4) Download the file with the haar cascade (attached to the repository), specify the path to this cascade.
5) Download all the necessary libraries: opencv, fuzzywuzzy, sqllite, twilio, matplotlib, time.

Code analysis in Russian with my comments will be uploaded to the same repository(link below).
